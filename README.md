# Assistive_Robotics

It investigates the what (modeling), how (design), and why (analysis) of assistive robotics through the use of model-based design process. System models are essential to four key aspects of the assistive robot design process: derivation of executable specifications, hardware and software design based on simulations, implementation by code generation, and continuous testing and verification.

Basic Definition of Assistive Robotics:
- Products, environmental modifications, services, and processes that enable access to and use of assistive products, specifically by persons with disabilities and older adults.

The files includes assignments, tasks and MATLAB code developed and implemented independently during the course.
