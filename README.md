# Assistive_Robotics

Investigates the what (modeling), how (design), and why (analysis) of assistive robotics through the use of model-based design process. System models are essential to four key aspects of the assistive robot design process: derivation of executable specifications, hardware and software design based on simulations, implementation by code generation, and continuous testing and verification. Course projects emphasize model-based design for control of assistive robots in smart environments.

The files includes assignments, tasks and MATLAB code developed and implemented during the course.

Products, environmental modifications,
services, and processes that enable access to
and use of assistive products, specifically by
persons with disabilities and older adults
